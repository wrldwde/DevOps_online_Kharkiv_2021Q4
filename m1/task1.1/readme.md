##### DevOps
**DevOps** is a way to automate and accelerate stages of working with software. The main purposes of DevOps are reducing *time to market*, decrease the _failure rate of new releases_, reduce *time needed to complete fixes*, reducing *the amount of time to recover* after new version fall or other shutdown cases. These goals are achived by *automating* development, testing and deployment processes, *management* IT infrastructure as a code, *change management*, *continuos monitoring* of application perfomance and infrastructure health.
